To make a CNN -- i assume a CNN class object here


We need to be able to convolutional Layers -- from which we pass filter objects from one layer to another
Maxpool layers -- maxpools the filter object
a flatten function to feed into fully connected layers
Fully Connected layers 
Softmax output

For all 
For all layers, we need to have activation (leaky relu)

For all initial variables for those layers, we need to have variable initalizers. We should implement Xaiver inialization or He initialization, whichever one is easier.
