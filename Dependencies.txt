To run the CNN, you have to have Bazel installed. 
Bazel is googles build system, and its what tensorflow is built off of.

For ubuntu installation, (16.04), I did:
	sudo apt-get install pkg-config zip g++ zlib1g-dev unzip python

Then, you have to download bazel. you have to download the right binary installer, and they are found in this gihub. 
The downloads follow this type of scheme: bazel-<version>-installer-linux-x86_64.sh 

And they can be found on this github link:
https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases

After downloading the right installer, you have to run it. Use these following commands (if you're on linux):
	chmod +x bazel-<version>-installer-linux-x86_64.sh

	./bazel-<version>-installer-linux-x86_64.sh --user 

**DO not SUDO the second command-- itll send bazel to your usr/local/ directory, which will be a HUGE headache later on. 
The reason why the --user option is there is to make sure bazel is installed in the $HOME/bin directory.

If you did sudo the last installer command, this next step is necessary. Otherwise, this next command, adding this directory onto your default paths.
The command is:
	export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin" 

If you want, you can add that export path command into your ~/.bashrc profile.

Excellent. 
Bazel is now installed. 
If you want to know how to use bazel, follow along.
